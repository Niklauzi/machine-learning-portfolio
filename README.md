# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate data scientist with a focus on health analytics, pharmacovigilance, and machine learning. Below are links to some of my key projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise.

## Projects

1. **[Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning](<https://github.com/Niklauzi/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Health%20Domain/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Diagnostic)/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Diagnostic).ipynb>)**  
   Developed a machine learning model for breast cancer diagnosis, achieving 96.33% accuracy, 95% precision, and 90% recall by preprocessing clinical data, engineering features, balancing the dataset, and evaluating performance with metrics like ROC-AUC (0.99)..
