# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate data scientist with a focus on health analytics, pharmacovigilance, and machine learning. Below are links to some of my key projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise.

## Projects

1. **[Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Niklauzi/Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic/blob/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20Diagnostic.ipynb)**  
   Developed a **Machining Learning** model for breast cancer diagnosis, achieving **98% accuracy**, **98% precision**, and **98% recall** by preprocessing clinical data, balancing the dataset with **SMOTE**, and evaluating performance using metrics like **ROC-AUC (1.00)** and **F1-Score (0.98)**. Visualized results through **ROC curves**, **precision-recall curves**, and **feature importance plots** to ensure robust and interpretable outcomes.
